# React Playground

Experiment lab for react. I did a lot of things and may be absurd things soon.

## Initialize Project
```shell
yarn install
```
## Folder Structure
Files are separated by project. Go to the `src\projects` directory then select the project you are looking for.<br>
In each project:<br>
- The `pages` directory stores the elements that make up a page
- The `components` directory stores all the components used in the project
- The `utils` directory stores additional utilities in the project
- file `*.types.ts` stores types
